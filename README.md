# vim-simple-guifont
The simple and portable way to `set guifont` on GVim.

## Without it üôÅ
```vim
if has('gui_win32') || has('gui_win64') || has('gui_macvim') " Windows, Mac
  " Complicated syntax; repetition of size (many places to change if needed)
  set guifont=Cascadia\ Code\ PL:h14,JetBrains\ Mono:h14,Hack:h14,Consolas:h14

elseif has('gui_gtk') " Linux
  " Different syntax; no support for alternatives; messes up if not found
  set guifont=Consolas\ 14
endif
```

## With it üòç
```vim
silent! call simple_guifont#Set(
  ['Cascadia Code PL', 'JetBrains Mono', 'Hack'], 'Consolas', 14)
```

## Usage
Add the following to you `vimrc`
(using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) in this example):
```vim
call plug#begin()
" ...
Plug 'awvalenti/vim-simple-guifont'
" ...
call plug#end()

" 'silent!' is optional. It avoids an error before the plugin is installed.
" You can omit it to show any error that occurs.
silent! call simple_guifont#Set(
  ['Cascadia Code PL', 'JetBrains Mono', 'Hack'], " From most to least preferred
  'Consolas', " Last option if all above fail. '*' opens a window to ask user.
  14 " Font size
)
```

## Internals
The operating system is detected and the appropriate strategy is chosen.
For Windows and Mac, it builds a string and sets it.
For Linux with GTK, much more is done: shell programs are called to get
a list of all installed fonts, then the best match is searched.
If one is not found, the fallback font is chosen.
To learn more, just browse the [source code](autolad/simple_guifont.vim).
